## What is LangChain?
LangChain is basically a tool that helps you build smart apps using big language models (like GPT). But instead of just giving it a question and getting a plain answer, LangChain lets you build apps that can **do more** — like look up real-time info, search documents, call APIs, or even control other tools.

### What does "interact with their environment" actually mean?

Think of it like this:

Normally, when you talk to a regular LLM, it's like talking to someone locked in a library with a ton of knowledge but no internet, no tools, no hands — just books and brainpower.

LangChain *gives that person hands and access to the outside world*.

So now they can:

* **Check today's weather** using an API
* **Read from a database** or PDF files
* **Search Google**
* **Write to a spreadsheet**
* **Trigger some code** or automation

That's what it means to **interact with their environment** — it's not just thinking anymore, it's *doing* stuff in the real world based on the thinking.

And "agentic" just means you can give the model a goal like "summarize these PDFs and send the main points to Slack," and it will figure out the steps to make it happen — like a mini digital assistant that doesn't need handholding.
