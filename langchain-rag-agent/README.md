`rag_agent.py`

Alright, grab your coffee — let's break this down like we're two tired devs just trying to make something cool without frying our brains.

So, here's what we're doing: we're gonna build a Python script that's actually *useful*. It uses **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and the **OpenWeatherMap API** to answer questions like:

"What's the forecast trend for next week?"

And it actually *thinks* about it — pulls the data, stores it, analyzes it, and responds like a little weather-nerd sidekick.

### 🧠 What We're Using

* **OpenAI** for the LLM (or any other provider you vibe with)
* [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com/) to handle the chaining and agent stuff
* [**FAISS**](https://faiss.ai/index.html) to store vectorized weather data so the agent can "remember" things
* **Requests** to make calls to the weather API

### 🔐 What You'll Need

* Your **OpenAI API key**
* Your **OpenWeatherMap API key** (grab one here: [openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api))

### ⚙️ What It Actually Does

* **Trend Analysis**: The LLM reads the weather docs and gives insights like "Temps are climbing all week" or "Rain's slowly creeping in."
* **Memory**: It remembers what you asked, so you can say, "Cool, now what about rain?" and it gets you.
* **Date Formatting**: You'll probs want to convert those ugly Unix timestamps into something human-readable — unless you like squinting at milliseconds.

### 🍰 That's It

You now have a solid little RAG agent that can chat about the weather *intelligently*. Want to go further? Bolt on a UI, make it talk, add a schedule — whatever. But this setup right here?
It's your base. You're good to go.

Now finish your coffee and let's go code. ☕🔥
